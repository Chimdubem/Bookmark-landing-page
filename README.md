## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Using JavaScript to implement smooth scrolling
- Styling of tabbed components
- Use of positioning(absolute and relative)

- Also, as for the Blue SVG-look-alike in the hero and features section, I created them in my css code as I hadn't known of the existence of this files. Got to know about it after designing the page, but since it looked okay i decided to leave it that way.

### Continued development

- Positioning and use of SVG's
- JavaScript implementation

- Email validation feature
